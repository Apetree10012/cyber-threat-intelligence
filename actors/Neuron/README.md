# Neuron - Cyber Threat Intelligence

The indicators are related to [VulDB CTI analysis](https://vuldb.com/?kb.cti) of the actor known as [Neuron](https://vuldb.com/?actor.neuron). The activity monitoring correlates data from social media, forums, chat rooms, and darknet markets. It helps to determine associated actors, activities, intentions, emerging research, and attacks. Our unique predictive model is able to forecast activities and their characteristics.

## Countries

These countries are directly (e.g. origin of attacks) or indirectly (e.g. access by proxy) associated with Neuron:

* US

## IOC - Indicator of Compromise

These indicators of compromise indicate associated network ressources which are known to be part of research and attack activities of Neuron.

ID | IP address | Hostname | Confidence
-- | ---------- | -------- | ----------
1 | 62.149.118.67 | mail.spa.gov.sa | High
2 | 85.194.112.9 | - | High
3 | 93.184.220.29 | - | High

## IOA - Indicator of Attack

These indicators of attack list the potential fragments used for technical activities like reconnaissance, exploitation, privilege escalation, and exfiltration by Neuron. This data is unique as it uses our predictive model for actor profiling.

ID | Type | Indicator | Confidence
-- | ---- | --------- | ----------
1 | File | `conf.c` | Low
2 | Argument | `Proxy-Authorization` | High
