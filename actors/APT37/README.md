# APT37 - Cyber Threat Intelligence

The indicators are related to [VulDB CTI analysis](https://vuldb.com/?kb.cti) of the actor known as [APT37](https://vuldb.com/?actor.apt37). The activity monitoring correlates data from social media, forums, chat rooms, and darknet markets. It helps to determine associated actors, activities, intentions, emerging research, and attacks. Our unique predictive model is able to forecast activities and their characteristics.
