# APT-C-01 - Cyber Threat Intelligence

These _indicators_ were reported, collected, and generated during the [VulDB CTI analysis](https://vuldb.com/?kb.cti) of the actor known as [APT-C-01](https://vuldb.com/?actor.apt-c-01). The _activity monitoring_ correlates data from social media, forums, chat rooms, and darknet markets. It helps to determine associated actors, specific activities, expected intentions, emerging research, and ongoing attacks. Our unique _predictive model_ uses _big data_ to forecast activities and their characteristics.

_Live data_ and more _analysis capabilities_ are available at [https://vuldb.com/?actor.apt-c-01](https://vuldb.com/?actor.apt-c-01)

## Countries

These _countries_ are directly (e.g. origin of attacks) or indirectly (e.g. access by proxy) associated with APT-C-01:

* [US](https://vuldb.com/?country.us)
* [CN](https://vuldb.com/?country.cn)
* [RU](https://vuldb.com/?country.ru)

There are 3 more country items available. Please use our online service to access the data.

## IOC - Indicator of Compromise

These _indicators of compromise_ (IOC) indicate associated network resources which are known to be part of research and attack activities of APT-C-01.

ID | IP address | Hostname | Campaign | Confidence

## TTP - Tactics, Techniques, Procedures

_Tactics, techniques, and procedures_ (TTP) summarize the suspected ATT&CK techniques used by _APT-C-01_. This data is unique as it uses our predictive model for actor profiling.

ID | Technique | Weakness | Description | Confidence
-- | --------- | -------- | ----------- | ----------
1 | T1059.007 | CWE-79, CWE-80 | Cross Site Scripting | High
2 | T1068 | CWE-264, CWE-284 | Execution with Unnecessary Privileges | High

## IOA - Indicator of Attack

These _indicators of attack_ (IOA) list the potential fragments used for technical activities like reconnaissance, exploitation, privilege escalation, and exfiltration by APT-C-01. This data is unique as it uses our predictive model for actor profiling.

ID | Type | Indicator | Confidence
-- | ---- | --------- | ----------
1 | File | `/forum/away.php` | High
2 | File | `/goform/saveParentControlInfo` | High
3 | File | `/uncpath/` | Medium
4 | File | `2020\Messages\SDNotify.exe` | High
5 | ... | ... | ...

There are 33 more IOA items available (file, library, argument, input value, pattern, network port). Please use our online service to access the data.
