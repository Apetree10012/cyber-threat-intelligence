# MuddyWater - Cyber Threat Intelligence

These _indicators_ were reported, collected, and generated during the [VulDB CTI analysis](https://vuldb.com/?kb.cti) of the actor known as [MuddyWater](https://vuldb.com/?actor.muddywater). The _activity monitoring_ correlates data from social media, forums, chat rooms, and darknet markets.
