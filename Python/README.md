# Python - Cyber Threat Intelligence

The indicators are related to [VulDB CTI analysis](https://vuldb.com/?kb.cti) of the actor known as [Python](https://vuldb.com/?actor.python). The activity monitoring correlates data from social media, forums, chat rooms, and darknet markets. It helps to determine associated actors, activities, intentions, emerging research, and attacks. Our unique predictive model is able to forecast activities and their characteristics.

## Countries

These countries are directly (e.g. origin of attacks) or indirectly (e.g. access by proxy) associated with Python:

* US

## IOC - Indicator of Compromise

These indicators of compromise indicate associated network ressources which are known to be part of research and attack activities of Python.

ID | IP address | Hostname | Confidence

## TTP - Tactics, Techniques, Procedures

Tactics, techniques, and procedures summarize the suspected ATT&CK techniques used by Python. This data is unique as it uses our predictive model for actor profiling.

ID | Technique | Description | Confidence
-- | --------- | ----------- | ----------
1 | T1552 | Unprotected Storage of Credentials | High
