# APT12 - Cyber Threat Intelligence

The indicators are related to [VulDB CTI analysis](https://vuldb.com/?kb.cti) of the actor known as [APT12](https://vuldb.com/?actor.apt12). The activity monitoring correlates data from social media, forums, chat rooms, and darknet markets. It helps to determine associated actors, activities, intentions, emerging research, and attacks. Our unique predictive model is able to forecast activities and their characteristics.

Live data and more analysis capabilities are available at [https://vuldb.com/?actor.apt12](https://vuldb.com/?actor.apt12)

## TTP - Tactics, Techniques, Procedures

Tactics, techniques, and procedures summarize the suspected ATT&CK techniques used by APT12. This data is unique as it uses our predictive model for actor profiling.

ID | Technique | Description | Confidence
-- | --------- | ----------- | ----------
1 | T1059.007 | Cross Site Scripting | High
2 | T1499 | Resource Consumption | High

## IOA - Indicator of Attack

These indicators of attack list the potential fragments used for technical activities like reconnaissance, exploitation, privilege escalation, and exfiltration by APT12. This data is unique as it uses our predictive model for actor profiling.

ID | Type | Indicator | Confidence
-- | ---- | --------- | ----------
1 | File | `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` | High
2 | Argument | `repeater` | Medium
3 | Network Port | `tcp/264` | Low
