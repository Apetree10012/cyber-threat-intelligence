# Microsoft Exchange - Cyber Threat Intelligence

These _indicators_ were reported, collected, and generated during the [VulDB CTI analysis](https://vuldb.com/?kb.cti) of the campaign known as _Microsoft Exchange_. The _activity monitoring_ correlates data from social media, forums, chat rooms, and darknet markets. It helps to determine associated actors, specific activities, expected intentions, emerging research, and ongoing attacks. Our unique _predictive model_ uses _big data_ to forecast activities and their characteristics.

_Live data_ and more _analysis capabilities_ are available at [https://vuldb.com/?actor](https://vuldb.com/?actor)

## Countries

These _countries_ are directly (e.g. origin of attacks) or indirectly (e.g. access by proxy) associated with Microsoft Exchange:

## Actors

These _actors_ are associated with Microsoft Exchange or other actors linked to the campaign.

ID | Actor | Confidence
-- | ----- | ----------
1 | [Tortilla](https://vuldb.com/?actor.tortilla) | High
2 | [Unknown](https://vuldb.com/?actor.unknown) | High

## IOC - Indicator of Compromise

These _indicators of compromise_ (IOC) indicate associated network resources which are known to be part of research and attack activities of Microsoft Exchange.

ID | IP address | Hostname | Actor | Confidence
-- | ---------- | -------- | ----- | ----------
1 | [54.221.65.242](https://vuldb.com/?ip.54.221.65.242) | ec2-54-221-65-242.compute-1.amazonaws.com | [Tortilla](https://vuldb.com/?actor.tortilla) | Medium
2 | [168.119.93.163](https://vuldb.com/?ip.168.119.93.163) | dupa.tk | [Tortilla](https://vuldb.com/?actor.tortilla) | High
3 | [185.219.52.229](https://vuldb.com/?ip.185.219.52.229) | - | [Tortilla](https://vuldb.com/?actor.tortilla) | High

## TTP - Tactics, Techniques, Procedures

_Tactics, techniques, and procedures_ (TTP) summarize the suspected MITRE ATT&CK techniques used within Microsoft Exchange. This data is unique as it uses our predictive model for actor profiling.

ID | Technique | Weakness | Description | Confidence
-- | --------- | -------- | ----------- | ----------
1 | T1068 | CWE-269 | Execution with Unnecessary Privileges | High
